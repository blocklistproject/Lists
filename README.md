# Details:
These lists were created because the founder of the project wanted something with a little more control over what is being blocked. Many lists are all or nothing. We set out to create lists with more control over what is being blocked.
&nbsp;
## Versions:
We have recently created an alternative version (Alt-Version) of our lists. 
<p>Original Version:</p>
<p>&nbsp;All urls in the version of the list are listed in the host file as follows</p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;0.0.0.0 example.com</p>
<p>Alternative Version:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;All urls in this version of the list are listed in the host file as follows</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;example.com</p>

Our users brought it to our attention that some devices error out if the url is preceded by an IP address. 

&nbsp;

# Usage:
These converted files can be used with various DNS and domain-blocking tools:

## Using with [Pi-Hole](https://pi-hole.net/):

1. Copy the link to the Pi-Hole format for the desired list (from the appropriate table below).
2. Add the URL to your Pi-Hole's block lists (**Login** > **Group Management** > **Adlists** > **Paste list URL in "Address" field, add comment** > **Click "Add"**)
3. Update Gravity (**Tools** > **Update Gravity** > **Click "Update"** )
