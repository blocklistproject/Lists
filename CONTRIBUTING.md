Contributing to The Block List Project

Without the communities help and input this won't work! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a false positive

- Discussing the current state of the lists

- Submitting a removal request

- Proposing new URL

- Becoming a maintainer

We interact with Github

We use github to host the lists, to track false positives and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

Issues are the best way to propose changes to the lists (we use Github Flow). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from master.

2. Ensure that you have not modified any files inside the `alt-version` `adguard` `dnsmasq-version` folders or
inside `everything.txt`. Automatic scripts will update those files for you.

3. Issue that pull request!

Any contributions you make will be under the Unlincense License

Report bugs using Github's issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs/false positives. Report a false positive by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

Write reports with detail, background, and why you believe the url is a false positive.
